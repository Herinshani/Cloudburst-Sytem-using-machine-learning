# Cloudburst-Sytem-using-machine-learning
     Cloudbursts are sudden, intense rainfall events that can lead to flash floods, landslides, and other disasters.By combining CNN and GAF, our proposed model aims to capture both the local and global spatial dependencies crucial for accurate cloudburst prediction.
