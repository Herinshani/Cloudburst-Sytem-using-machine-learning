# Cloudburst-Sytem-using-machine-learning
     Cloudbursts are sudden, intense rainfall events that can lead to flash floods, landslides, and other disasters.By combining CNN and GAF, our proposed model aims to capture both the local and global spatial dependencies crucial for accurate cloudburst prediction. 
## About
   The purpose of the project for Cloudburst Prediction with CNN and Gramian Angular Field (GAF) lies in addressing the critical need for accurate and timely prediction of cloudburst events, which pose significant risks to lives, infrastructure, and the environment.The project aims to provide stakeholders with a more accurate and reliable tool for mitigating the impacts of cloudburst events and enhancing disaster preparedness efforts.
